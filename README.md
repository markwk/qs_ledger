# Quantified Self (QS) Ledger

## A Personal Data Aggregator and Dashboard for Self-Trackers and Quantified Self Enthusiasts

[Quantfied Self (QS) Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) aggregates and visualizes your personal data.

The project has two primary goals:

1. **download all of your personal data** from various tracking services (see below for list of integration services) and store locally.
2. provide the starting point for **personal data analysis, data visualization and a personal data dashboard**

At present, the main objective is to provide working data downloaders and simple data analysis for each of the integrated services.

Some initial work has been started on using these data streams for predictive analytics and forecasting using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and the intention to increasingly focus on modeling in future iterations. .

### Code / Dependencies:

* The code is written in Python 3.
* Shared and distributed via Jupyter Notebooks.
* To get started, we recommend downloading and using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
* For installation, setup and usage of individual services, see documentation provided by each integration.
* Most services depend on Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplot and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.
* Each project has a NAME_downloader and NAME_data_analysis.
